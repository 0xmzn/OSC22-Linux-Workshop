## What is an operating system?
An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.

**Examples:** Unix, Minix, Linux, macOS and Microsoft Windows.

## What is Linux?
Linux has been around since the mid-1990s and has since reached a user-base that spans the globe. Linux is actually everywhere: It's in your phones, your thermostats, in your cars, refrigerators, and televisions. It also runs most of the Internet, all of the world’s top 500 supercomputers, and the world’s stock exchanges.


Here's an example of a smartwatch running Linux:

**Fun fact:** Most laptops used by the astronauts run a Linux based operating systems (Debian).

**Note:** The *correct term* is GNU/Linux not just Linux or GNU, because it is the GNU operating system using the Linux kernel. 
We just say Linux because it is shorter, easier to say, and more popular.
